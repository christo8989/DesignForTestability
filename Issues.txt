  -	ArgumentException is based on two parameters. What if a new enum type is added and expects filter to have a value?
  - The query string is hard coded into the method
  - retryCount is hard coded into the method.
  - while(true) relies on the try catch. The catch shouldn't dictate this kind of logic. Not sure what's wrong but it feels wrong.
  - Shouldn't the reader return a list of Employees. 

Employee is good.
FakeSql is good (of course the query is bogus and all that).
